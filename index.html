            The earliest african art is from 77,000 years ago. African artist used a collection of metal, 
            ivory, wood, and clay. Art was used for spirital reasons and the artists were rarely recoginzed. Most of Africa's history has been passed down orally. 
            This is done through dance, music, and performances. Many cultures created masks that were used 
            for dance. A lot of African art is not realistic. The artists generally preferred create more abstract art.
